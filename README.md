# Lazy Evaluation and Caching using Java

I designed LazyNumberDetails as a Java class to efficiently analyze natural numbers 
for their prime, perfect, and magic properties.This class implements two powerful 
optimization mechanisms - lazy evaluation and caching - to improve the performance of
these computationally intensive operations. With LazyNumberDetails, users can quickly
and easily analyze large numbers and retrieve detailed information about their properties.
